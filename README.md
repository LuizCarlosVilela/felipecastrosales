<h1 align="center">Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">, I'm Felipe Sales</h1>

<h4 align="center">How are you? I hope you are well, welcome to my profile. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜„</h4>

<p align="center">
I'm passionate about programming and development, and I'm always wanting to help people reach the next level, to be better always more. Besides being part of my essence, I try to pass it on to people, the feeling of progress and consistency captivates me.<br>
I want to be the best I can, giving my best and constantly challenging myself, and that's when I feel comfortable, because I know it's an opportunity to evolve. I have clear goals, and goals that I set with my inner self. The main thing is to be better than I was yesterday, this is my biggest enemy.<br>
The programming and experience of being a teaching assistant changed my thinking a lot, besides, of course, making me learn more. I know I can and I offer a lot to people, especially the opportunity to make them grow, be better and change their lives. This move me.
